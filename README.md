## Installation

The local computing environment should already have a recent version of node and npm installed. If not please do so before continuing. After updating your versions of npm and node you should then run 'npm install', 'npm install fs-extra', and 'npm install inquirer' to make sure all dependencies are available and updated. After you have completed these steps you should be ready to run the team profile generator.
